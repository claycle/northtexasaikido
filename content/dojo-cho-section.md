## Classes Cancelled This Weekend

The expected arrival time of freezing precipitation keeps getting moved back and forth, but we expect ice to begin sometime during class time Friday and continue throughout the day Saturday and Sunday. Even if the timeframe is off on Friday, we don’t want to take a chance on anybody traveling over icy bridges. Saturday is supposed to be cold. REALLY COLD. Stay home, stay warm, and don’t forget to cover your faucets. We’ll see you again once Texas thaws back out.
