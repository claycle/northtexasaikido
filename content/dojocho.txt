We have restored our [normal class schedule](/classes/schedule/) at the dojo in the evenings. We will have regular practice on Tuesday through Friday evenings at 7:30 PM and weapons practice on Saturday mornings at 9 AM.

Classes are open to all North Texas Aikido adult students who have been fully vaccinated.
