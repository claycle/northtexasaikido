Aikido is written in Japanese using three characters. They are translated as “Ai” - Harmony, “Ki” - Spirit, and “Do” - the Way; or in one translation, "The way of spiritual harmony." It is a comparatively modern and extremely sophisticated martial art. Being purely self-defensive, it stresses the avoidance of conflict as an integral part of its philosophical and technical tenets.
