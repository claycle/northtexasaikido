Monthly Dues
{{< /hmod >}}

The traditional view is that one cannot buy this type of instruction; it must be given freely and the burden of learning rests solely on the student. The dues and fees you pay are merely a way of insuring that the dojo will be sustained and the at the training and instruction can continue to progress.

Our payment policy is simple. Dues should be paid before the first of the month. We request that you be as prompt as possible. Like everyone else, we have financial obligations and like to take care of them in a timely fashion.

Dues are not transferable from month to month. Whether you attend every class or cannot attend at all, dues are required for the month. If you cannot meet these requirements for any reason, please discuss it with the *dojo cho* and we'll work something out. Communication is very important.

For new students joining in the middle of the month, you will pay one month's dues, and then we will prorate the following month.
